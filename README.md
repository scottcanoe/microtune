# microtune: a tuning app supporting arbitrary tuning systems

microtune can be used to estimate the fundamental frequency of sounds and accurately tune instruments according to any tuning system or pitch standard. The pitch (and fundamental frequency) estimator is based on [YIN](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11367890_YIN_A_fundamental_frequency_estimator_for_speech_and_music),  an autocorrelation-based algorithm  called YIN.
